# Integration and scripting options

### HTTP API

Simple DNS Plus can be prompted through HTTP to perform various actions - either with a browser or from any program/script which can communicate through HTTP.  
It is also possible to manipulate DNS zone and record data this way. For details, see [How to use HTTP commands](https://simpledns.plus/helplink?p=ht_http) in the Simple DNS Plus help file and [this article](/kb/115/sending-simple-dns-plus-http-commands).

### Open plug-in architecture

We welcome users and 3rd parties to develop plug-ins for Simple DNS Plus.  
Please see [this article](/kb/31/developing-plug-ins-for-simple-dns-plus-v5-2-and-later) for details.
