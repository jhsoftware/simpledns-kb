# How to enable DNS over TLS (DoT) in Android

DNS over TLS (DoT) - or "Private DNS" as it is called in Android - is a way to encrypt DNS queries and responses between a user's device and the resolving DNS server. For more on this see [New in Simple DNS Plus v. 9.0](/kb/194).

To enable this in Android, do the following.

Note the following screen shots and instructions are taken from a Samsung Galaxy 9 Phone with Android version 10. The steps and settings may be different on other devices / versions.

From your home screen, locate and click the Settings icon:
