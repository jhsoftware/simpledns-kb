# Arranging and docking windows in Simple DNS Plus

Simple DNS Plus version 5.x uses a window docking system similar to that of Microsoft's Visual Studio.  
This should make it much easier to arrange the Performance Graph, Active Log View, and Plug-in windows just the way you want them.

For users who are not familiar with this system, it may be a bit confusing to use at first.  
But once you "get it", it is really very simple to use.

The video below shows how to use the docking system:

(Sorry for the multiple cursor etc. - the video is a screen recording of an old Flash demo - which browsers cannot display anymore)
