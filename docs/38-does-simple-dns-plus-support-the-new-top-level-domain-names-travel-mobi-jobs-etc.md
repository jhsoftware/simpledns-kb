# Does Simple DNS Plus support the new top level domain names? (.travel .mobi .jobs etc.)

Yes, these domain names (and any future names) are automatically recognized immediately once they are activated.  
The Internet root DNS servers will then be updated to include these names and they will instantly be available throughout the Internet.
