# DynDNS clients supporting TSIG signed updates

Simple DNS Plus supports TSIG signed dynamic updates directly through the DNS protocol.  
This is the most efficient and recommend way to do dynamic updates.

DynDNS client software known to support TSIG signed dynamic DNS updates:

\- "DynSite" from [http://noeld.com/dynsite.asp](http://noeld.com/dynsite.asp){target=_blank} (Windows)

\- "Direct Update" from [http://www.directupdate.net](http://www.directupdate.net){target=_blank} (Windows)

\- "IPUpdate" from [http://ipupdate.sourceforge.net](http://ipupdate.sourceforge.net){target=_blank} (Windows / Linux)

Alternatively you can use almost any existing DynDNS client software by using HTTP based updates - see reference article below.
