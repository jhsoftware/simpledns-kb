# Integration and scripting options

### HTTP API

Simple DNS Plus can be prompted through HTTP to perform various actions - either with a browser or from any program/script which can communicate through HTTP.  
It is also possible to manipulate DNS zone and record data this way. For details, see [How to use HTTP commands](https://simpledns.plus/helplink?p=ht_http) in the Simple DNS Plus help file and [this article](/kb/115/sending-simple-dns-plus-http-commands).

### JavaScript plug-in

With the [JavaScript plug-in](/plugin-javascript), you can write your own custom logic for DNS query processing in JavaScript.
