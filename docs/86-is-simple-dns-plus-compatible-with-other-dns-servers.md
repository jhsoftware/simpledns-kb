# Is Simple DNS Plus compatible with other DNS servers?

Yes - Simple DNS Plus is based on the public standards (RFCs) just like other DNS server programs including "BIND" which is commonly used on Unix/Linux systems.

Simple DNS Plus can import / export DNS zones from / to standard zone files (a.k.a. "master files") according to RFC standards.  
This means that you can exchange zone files / data with other standard based DNS servers.
